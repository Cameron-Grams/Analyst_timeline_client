needed to change the default react-router-redux to "react-router-redux": "^5.0.0-alpha.9",

8 Feb
- ProfileLoader and the boolean values; method of restricting state of app...
- use of token function and the tests for dashboard

23 Feb
- method for sorting entries on the timeline call of the timeline router

Problem:
moving back to the user-timelines drops the userTimeline information; theory is this is because the user information is moved by the 
token, and the token does not have access to all the user profile, specifically the timelines...
>>>> Wrong, the issue was with the ids for the timelines, not the full collection member being returned...fixed....?
>>>> Second problem was the name of the property coming off of the db; needed to be sent timelines: userTimelines


Problem:
the dashboard timeline graphic is still not updating after the new entry has been added to the timeline; theory is this is because
the current DOM of the timeline has not re-rendered and drawn down the new data members
>>>>



Problem:
Inconsistent ordering of entries sorted chonologically; seen after first update remains the earliest on the timeline if a previous
date was entered in the collection

========================


update entries

added sort of new entries on return; problem with the storage by id

added undefined to the profile loader to ensure the /user-timelines endpoint reloaded with user 
  info

added a call to the getSelectedTimeline with the timeline id after adding a new entry iot ensure
  the timeline rendered with the added entry
