The Analyst's Timeline is a tool built to organize research. An analyst can establish a theme for research in a given area by creating a timeline, and then populate the timeline with significant events that develop their understanding of the topic.  

The application itself was built using React with Redux to manage overall app state.  It is hosted on Netlify for the client and Heroku for the server, and makes use of mLab cloud based MongoDB hosting to maintain the records.
