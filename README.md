# Analyst Timeline Client

[The Live Site]( https://amazing-davinci-10dc21.netlify.com/login )

This is the Analyst's Timeline built to organize research. An analyst can establish a theme for research in a given area by creating a timeline, and then populate the timeline with significant events that develop their understanding of the topic.

The site application itself was built using React and Redux to manage overall app state.  It is hosted on Netlify for the client and Heroku for the server, and makes use of the mLab cloud based MongoDB hosting.
